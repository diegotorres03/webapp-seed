# webapp-seed
Template for a web app using mediator pattern and Vanilla JS

## Motivation

In this days the landscape of JavaScript frameworks seem to be growing and growing.

With the overwhelming amount of tools, libraries and frameworks is good from time to time go to the base.

Nowadays we have a lot of tools built in Javascrip and the browsers, so... why not take advantage of that?

This project is a way to explore the process of build a Single Web Application using Vanilla JS.

I'm not saying the use of JS libraries or frameworks is Wrong (I love them).

Is just that using those everyday we tend to forget the true power of HTML 5, CSS 3 and Javascript.
