# webapp-seed
Template for a web app using mediator pattern

## Synopsis

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

In this days the landscape of JavaScript frameworks seem to be growing and growing.

With the overwhelming amount of tools, libraries and frameworks is good from time to time go to the base.

Nowadays we have a lot of tools built in Javascrip and the browsers, so... why not take advantage of that?

This project is a way to explore the proces of build a Single Web Application using Vanilla JS.

I'm not saying the use of JS libraries or frameworks is Wrong (I love them).

Is just that using those everyday we tend to forget the true power of HTML 5, CSS 3 and Javascript.
